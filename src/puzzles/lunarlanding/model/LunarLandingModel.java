     * Code here includes...
     * Additional data variables for anything needed beyond what is in
     *   the config object to describe the current state of the puzzle
     * Methods to support the controller part of the GUI, e.g., load, move
     * Methods and data to support the "subject" side of the Observer pattern
     *
     * WARNING: To support the hint command, you will likely have to do
     *   a cast of Config to LunarLandingConfig somewhere, since the solve
     *   method works with, and returns, objects of type Configuration.
